# Clarity_data
The Testing team is receiving results of testing from three Vendors RRT, MedRite, Premier that feed into T2DAP.
This is Vendor Testing project, which has a dedicated repository, pipeline and slack channel.

The data is used for the reporting. There is other testing data on the CovResponse and Clarity databases on 2 other servers: the original view was uploaded on Clarity database, then a table was created. Then a job was created to get this data to the OPHW database to be more free in managing. 
Clarity doesnâ€™t allow any space of maneuver. Currently the request is to make data more accessible on our database, T2DAP.
